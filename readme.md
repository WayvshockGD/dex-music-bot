**NOTE:**

I do not help with any issues you run into.
I've spent too much time on rewriting the code over from discord.js V11 to V12 which broke alot.
It works now, not amazingly stable but it does what it needs to do.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**GUIDE:**

Put the token and the prefix in the .env file.

The bot should come online.

Run the "commands" command to see all available command and their usage

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EXTRA INFO:**

This bot is completely free to copy and you can share it with anyone you'd like.


Not to beg or anything but it would be nice to give me a thanks when you use this,
I put alot of time and effort in making it work. :D
